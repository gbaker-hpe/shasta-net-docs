## Development Notes

I use the (klakegg/hugo:0.101.0-alpine container)[https://hub.docker.com/r/klakegg/hugo] for development.  It contains a base installation of Hugo that can be used for builds, hosting a development web server, or interactively working with the Hugo CLI.

### Pulling the Hugo container image (Alpine)

```
docker pull klakegg/hugo:0.101.0-alpine
```

### Building the project

(From the project top-level directory)

```
docker run --rm -it --name hugo -v $(pwd)/src:/src klakegg/hugo:0.101.0-alpine
```

### Launching the Hugo shell from the top-level project directory

(From the project top-level directory)

```
docker run --rm -it --name hugo -v $(pwd)/src:/src klakegg/hugo:0.101.0-alpine shell
```
